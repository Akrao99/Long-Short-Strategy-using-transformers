# Long-Short-Strategy-using-transformers
Long-Short Transformer for Financial Trading
  
Project Overview
This project, implemented in longShortTransformer_2.ipynb, develops a Transformer-based model for predicting long/short trading signals in financial markets. It uses TA-Lib to compute technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) from historical market data, feeding them into a custom Transformer architecture to optimize trading decisions. The notebook is designed for Google Colab, leveraging GPU/TPU acceleration for efficient training and evaluation.
Key Features

Data Processing: Fetches OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data and computes technical indicators.
Model: Transformer with [specify layers, heads, e.g., 4 layers, 8 attention heads] for predicting buy/sell signals.
Evaluation: Measures performance via [e.g., Sharpe ratio, cumulative returns].
Environment: Optimized for Google Colab, with support for local Jupyter setups.

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name


Google Colab Setup:

Upload longShortTransformer_2.ipynb to Colab.
Run the TA-Lib installation cell:!wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
!tar -xzvf ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
!cd ta-lib && ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install
!pip install TA-Lib numpy pandas torch tensorflow yfinance




Local Setup (optional):

Install TA-Lib manually (see TA-Lib guide).
Install dependencies:pip install numpy pandas torch tensorflow yfinance TA-Lib





Usage

Run the Notebook:

In Colab, open longShortTransformer_2.ipynb and execute cells sequentially.
Locally, use:jupyter notebook longShortTransformer_2.ipynb


Steps include data fetching (e.g., via yfinance), indicator calculation, model training, and backtesting.


Customize:

Adjust dataset (e.g., stock symbols, timeframe: [specify, e.g., 2015-2025 daily data]).
Tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, epochs) in the notebook.



Project Details

Data: Historical stock data from [e.g., Yahoo Finance via yfinance], processed into sequences with technical indicators.
Model: Transformer with [specify architecture details], trained on [loss function, e.g., cross-entropy] using [optimizer, e.g., Adam].
Output: Long/short signals (+1 for buy, -1 for sell).
Results: [Add metrics, e.g., "Sharpe Ratio: X.XX, Annualized Return: XX%"], with visualizations like cumulative return plots.

Troubleshooting

GitHub Rendering Error ("state key missing"):
Clean widget metadata to fix rendering on GitHub:import json
def clean_notebook(filepath):
    try:
        with open(filepath, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            notebook = json.load(f)
        modified = False
        if "metadata" in notebook and "widgets" in notebook["metadata"]:
            del notebook["metadata"]["widgets"]
            modified = True
        for cell in notebook.get("cells", []):
            if "metadata" in cell and "widgets" in cell["metadata"]:
                del cell["metadata"]["widgets"]
                modified = True
        if modified:
            with open(filepath, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                json.dump(notebook, f, indent=2)
            print(f"Cleaned {filepath}")
            return True
        print(f"No widgets found in {filepath}")
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing {filepath}: {str(e)}")
        return False
clean_notebook("longShortTransformer_2.ipynb")


Re-upload to GitHub after cleaning.


TA-Lib Issues: Ensure proper installation; check Colab disk space or use Colab Pro.
Alternative Rendering: Use nbviewer for robust notebook display.
